Changes from 1.5rc2
===================

* FIX: Compilation on Tru64 systems was broken, since libtool's acinclude.m4
       file on the packagers system did not contain the necessary patch.

Changes from 1.5rc1
===================

* FIX: contrib/shell_utils/lp2pap.sh was erased when "make clean" was called.
       Now we distribute lp2pap.sh.tmpl instead, and lp2pap.sh is automatically
       generated during package build.
* FIX: Some platforms (notably Tru64) don't have the snprintf() call, which
       was used in etc/afp/afp_config.c. This call was replaced by sprintf()
       and prior bounds checking.
