Changes from 1.5.3
==================

* FIX: --with-nls-dir option does now work

Changes from 1.5.2
==================

* UPD: Extend the --disable-shell-check functionality to ignore users
       with _no_ shell.  Also, send a log message if a user is refused login
       based on the fact that they have no shell.
* UPD: Autoconf updates.
* UPD: Tru64 afpd authentication updates.
* UPD: As always: lots of minor code cleanups.
* FIX: Problems with Photoshop trying to open image files has been
       corrected.
* FIX: Preserve special permission bits when creating or modifying
       directories.
* FIX: afp_deleteid() now deletes the specified file and not the parent
       directory.
* FIX: papd does now announce that it supports binary data to its clients.
* FIX: NetBSD ELF support.
* FIX: acleandir.rc is now installed in the bin directory.
* FIX: megatron does now compile even if compiled with -DDEBUG.
* FIX: Clean up some syslog messages.

Changes from 1.5.1
==================

* NEW: NetBSD support contributed by David Rankin and NetBSD contributors.
       This includes a new configure option --enable-netbsd.
* NEW: Add the -client_polling afpd.conf flag to allow for clients to poll
       the server every 10 seconds for open window updates.  Currently
       this is the only way to get asynchronous directory updates.
* UPD: Use separate macro for AFS configure check.
* UPD: Some Perl scripts are now (partially) auto-generated. This improves
       out-of-the-box usage of Netatalk.
* UPD: Solaris Kernel Makefile is now auto-generated. This fixes some path
       issues, but isn't perfect, yet. Added some Solaris compatibility
       fixes to the Kernel sources, too.
* UPD: CNID DB code sync'd with the current CVS version.  NOTE: Using this
       code requires you to delete _all_ existing .AppleDB directories in
       order to avoid database corruption!
* FIX: The file AppleVolumes.system contained wrong line breaks so that
       not all file types were properly recognized.
* FIX: AFS compilation would fail due to a misnamed variable.
* FIX: SLP configure check was wrong so SLP did not compile.
* FIX: Fix the way quotas are handled under certain situations.
* FIX: Do not enable debugging code if debugging option is not set.
* FIX: Some problems with wrongly assigned DIDs were fixed.
* FIX: Various bug fixes and code cleanups.

Changes from 1.5.0
==================

* NEW: Added a program called cnid_didname_verify that can be used to
       verify the consistency of the CNID database.
* NEW: New afpd option: -timeout. Warning: This still doesn't do what it's
       supposed to!
* UPD: Code cleanups and compatibility fixes to macusers.
* UPD: AppleVolumes.system was cleaned up.
* FIX: Really fix Tru64 compilation (see last entry).
* FIX: Hand correct error value back to AFP client when deleting files or
       directories fails.
* FIX: Leading or trailing spaces are now forbidden on volumes that have
       the AFPVOL_MSWINDOWS flag set.
* FIX: Minor code cleanups and warning fixes.
* FIX: Make quota support work on FreeBSD.

Changes from 1.5rc2
===================

* FIX: Compilation on Tru64 systems was broken, since libtool's acinclude.m4
       file on the packagers system did not contain the necessary patch.
* FIX: On some systems, atalkd refuses to start, since it couldn't detect
       any interfaces. This was caused by an overzealous validity check.

Changes from 1.5rc1
===================

* FIX: contrib/shell_utils/lp2pap.sh was erased when "make clean" was called.
       Now we distribute lp2pap.sh.tmpl instead, and lp2pap.sh is automatically
       generated during package build.
* FIX: Some platforms (notably Tru64) don't have the snprintf() call, which
       was used in etc/afp/afp_config.c. This call was replaced by sprintf()
       and prior bounds checking.
